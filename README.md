Python Programing
===================

## `Notes` and `words` are quoted and phrased from `Dr. Charles Severance Ph.D.`

Computers are built for one purpose - **to do things for us**

**What is Program?**
Set of **instructions**

## A CPU is actually a circuit with millions of transistors on it and runs 3 Billions instructions per second that means
## Main Memory(RAM - Random Access Memory)
- RAM is used to store the operating system, application programs, and data that are currently being processed.
- It plays a critical role in the computer's overall performance because it directly affects how fast applications run.
## Secondary Memory(Storage - Hard Drive, SSD, etc.)
- Data stored in secondary memory is typically accessed sequentially or with slightly longer access times compared to RAM.
