#Arithmetic Operators:
print(2+4) #added using print operator(+)

print(2-4) #subtracted using print operator

print(2*4) #multiplied using print operator

print(2/4) #divided using print operator

print(2//4) #divided using print operator

print(2%4) #modulus using print operator

print(2**4) #exponentiation using print operator    

#PEMDAS rule
#Lists are ordered collections of items.
#They are mutable
a = [1,2,3,4] #list of integer
b = ["Abdul,Qadir,Asif"] #list of string

#Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable
c = (1,2,3)#tuple

#Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
c = {"name": "Alice", 
     "age": 30, 
     "city": "New York"}

#sets
#Sets do not allow duplicate elements. 
#Sets are mutable
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(a)
print(b)
print(a+b) #list concatenate when used addition operator


# Comparison Operators:Always return true and false
print(a==b)#equal
print(a == b)
print(a!=b)
print(4>2)
print(4<2)
print(4<=2)
print(4>=2)
